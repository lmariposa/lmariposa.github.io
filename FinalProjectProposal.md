# Final Project Proposal
-----

## Description of the Deliverable

 For this final project I aim to create my own website. I will use my personal github.io.
This website will be focused on my life, music and social media presence. I would like
individuals who visit my website to feel connected to me and my online presence. This
website site will be compatible with mobile devices, desktops and tablets.

-----


## What problem does the project solve?

  Currently there are multiple different places on the internet that individuals can visit
to connect with my online presence. I have Facebook, Youtube, Instagram and Soundcloud accounts. These
websites have little to no link between each-other. My new Website will solve this problem.
My website will allow individuals to access each of these accounts as well as a personal blog
and a full bio. I want an online space in which an individual can visit to hear my story.
I don't currently have an online space that is meant to showcase my work as artist and individual.

## What resources will you use? (specific links to others' code)

  In order to complete this project I will use information provided on the W3 Schools Website.
  These links include...
 - [W3.CSS Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)
 - [Parallax Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_parallax.htm)
 - [Parallax Code](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_parallax&stacked=h)

I plan on using a CSS Template from W3 Schools to create my website.
This template is called "Parallax".

## What are the use cases? (who is your 'audience'?)

  My website will work as a "one stop shop" for individuals who would like to discover who I am as a person and 
an artist.  My audience will range from family, friends, fans, and future employers.
